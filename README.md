## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Built using only flexbox. I found CSS grid easier to use for positioning of elements on the page.

Learnt a lot about aligning, positioning, relative ratios and justifying flex items.

### Continued development

CSS only circles that are responsive.
Limit the width of a flex element in a page when it is the only element.
Use Vue to read data from json and populate the html page

### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - This helped me learn all about aligning flex items.
- [CSS circles that expand according to content](https://jsfiddle.net/36m7796q/2/) - Beautiful CSS circles .
